## Research Objectives
#### The focus is to find the best performance by providing an algorithm for detecting abusive and non-abusive Bangla comments. Hence the main objectives of this research are :
#### i. To detect abusive and non-abusive Bangla comments through the use of various machine learning algorithms.
#### ii. To provide the comparative performance among distinct machine learning algorithms.
#### iii.To investigate the most effective algorithm for detecting abusive comments on precision, recall, and accuracy value.
#### iv. To improve the existing system in term of accuracy and other performace parameters.
